📚 Top Theoretical Interview Questions: C++ Operators
1. What is the difference between endl and \n?
The Interviewer is looking for: Knowledge of the Buffer.

\n: It is a character that simply moves the cursor to the next line. It is faster.

endl: It moves the cursor to the next line and flushes the output buffer. This means it forces the computer to show the output on the screen immediately.

Verdict: Use \n for high-performance code and endl when you need to ensure the output is displayed right away.

2. What is "Short-Circuiting" in Logical Operators?
The Interviewer is looking for: Efficiency logic.

In C++, for Logical AND (&&), if the first condition is false, the second condition is never checked because the result will be false anyway.

In Logical OR (||), if the first condition is true, the second condition is skipped because the result is already guaranteed to be true.

Importance: This prevents unnecessary calculations and can avoid errors (like dividing by zero in the second condition).

3. What is the difference between Prefix and Postfix operators?
The Interviewer is looking for: Timing of execution.

Prefix (++a): "Change then Use." The value is incremented first, and then used in the expression.

Postfix (a++): "Use then Change." The current value is used in the expression first, and then the increment happens.

4. What is the "Scope Resolution Operator" (::)?
The Interviewer is looking for: Global vs. Local variable knowledge.

It is used to access a global variable when there is a local variable with the same name.

It is also used to define a function outside of a class or to access static members of a class.

Example: If you have a global int x and a local int x, you use ::x to refer to the global one.

5. Can you explain "Operator Precedence" and "Associativity"?
The Interviewer is looking for: How you handle complex expressions.

Precedence: Determines which operator is evaluated first (e.g., * has higher precedence than +).

Associativity: When two operators have the same precedence (like * and /), associativity determines the order (usually Left-to-Right).

6. What is the difference between the Assignment operator (=) and Equality operator (==)?
The Interviewer is looking for: Attention to syntax.

=: It is an assignment operator used to store a value into a variable (e.g., a = 10).

==: It is a relational operator used to compare two values. It returns true or false (e.g., if (a == 10)).

7. What is the use of the sizeof operator?
The Interviewer is looking for: Memory management basics.

It is a compile-time operator that returns the size (in bytes) of a data type or a variable.

Note: It is unique because even though it looks like a function, it is actually an operator.

8. What are Bitwise Operators and why are they used?
The Interviewer is looking for: Low-level programming awareness.

Operators like & (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), and ~ (NOT) work on individual bits of a number.

They are used in situations where performance is critical, such as embedded systems, encryption, or compression.

9. What is the Ternary Operator and what is its advantage?
The Interviewer is looking for: Ability to write clean, concise code.

The ternary operator (? :) is a shorthand for an if-else statement.

Syntax: condition ? expression1 : expression2;

Advantage: It makes the code more readable and compact for simple assignments.

10. Can we use the Modulo operator (%) with float/double values?
The Interviewer is looking for: Specific language constraints.

No. The % operator in C++ is strictly for integers.

Using it with float or double will result in a compile-time error.

(Pro Tip: If you really need the remainder of floating-point numbers, you use the fmod() function from the <cmath> library).
